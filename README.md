# advent-of-code-2021

To run this project you should have Node.js installed:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run 'npm test XX', where XX is the number of task and part of that task e.g. npm test 2b runs script for 2nd task part 2

This is not a presentation of how to write code, I use one-liners just to spice up the fun and make it harder ;)
